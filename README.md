Watchface for Watchy (SQFMI) - Black and White

no wifi, no bluetooth but long battery life

there is a time adjustment routine in Uhr.cpp

every day at 0:30 it sets back time by 15 seconds and 500 ms, because my Watchy runs too fast. Just delete it (or set another adjustment)

The outer ring shows the minutes, the middle ring the hours.
Search were white turns to black, there is the minute/hour hand.
The inner ring shows battery level. Complete black = battery full, complete white = battery empty.

You can crcle through the watchface by pushing the right buttons. 
This part of the watchface shows the average of todays steps and the number of steps of the last 6 days.
